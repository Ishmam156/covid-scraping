# covid-scraping
This is a script written in Python that scrapes through Worldometers COVID webpage. 
The script then saves all the relevent data in a list and later the date is written into a CSV file. 
Kindly note that Worldometers did not have a specific robots.txt file last I checked and therefore do the scraping at your own risk.
The script is working as of 3rd June 2020 and should work unless there is a change in the HTML structure of the page.
